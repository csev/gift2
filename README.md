This tool currently contains two pieces of related functionality:

* It can author and deliver GIFT-authored quizzes using LTI (index.php)
* It can convert to QTI 1.2 (convert.php)

These two pieces are related because they share a bunch of library code.

Preloading Quizzes
------------------

You can have this quiz tool consulta folder to pre-load quizzes.  Use the following 
configuration option in your `config.php`:

    $CFG->giftquizzes = $CFG->dirroot.'/../php-solutions/quiz';

It should be a folder with a serires of files that end in `*.txt` in the
GIFT format.  You can store these files in a private GitHub repo.  You can 
also add a password to all the files by creating the file `.lock` in the folder
and put in a single line with the plaintext password to unlock the quzzes.

You can request a default quiz from this folder using a GET parameter:

    http://localhost:8888/wa4e/mod/gift/?quiz=00-CSS.txt

The instructor still needs to go in and configure the quiz - but the right quiz 
will be pre-populated in the configuration drop down and pre-loaded if there
is no `.lock` file.

Quiz format convertor from GIFT to QTI 1.2
==========================================

This is a simple converter that lets you paste in GIFT formatted quiz questions like:


    // multiple choice with specified feedback for right and wrong answers
    ::Q2:: What's between orange and green in the spectrum? 
    { =yellow # right; good! ~red # wrong, it's yellow ~blue # wrong, it's yellow }

And get them downloaded as QTI 1.2 for import into lots of systems like Sakai and 
Canvas.

GIFT seems to be a micro-format invented by the Moodle community - and a pretty cool 
idea if I do say so myself.  I like it because I can put quizzes in GitHub :)
